# 🎬 MovieLens 1M Recommender Systems with PyTorch

Welcome to this practical machine learning project where we build and compare two powerful recommendation models using the **MovieLens 1M** dataset. This repository features:

- A **Neural Collaborative Filtering** model (NCF_MLP)
- A **Denoising Autoencoder** for collaborative filtering

Both models are built from scratch in **PyTorch**.

## 🔍 Project Summary

This project explores **user-movie rating prediction** using collaborative filtering. We apply two deep learning approaches and evaluate their performance using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**.
